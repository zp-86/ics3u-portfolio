# Portfolio-template
This is a Portfolio Template - to be used by students taking Ms. Kim's ICS3U OR ICS4U.

Welcome! This is your starting point for creating your GitHub Pages portfolio.  

# How to Edit Your Website
- Edit `index.md` to customize your homepage.  
- Add reflections in the `posts/` folder after completing each unit or project.
- [optional] You may also write additional reflections whenever you like.
- Put images(e.g.,screenshots of your work) in the `assets/` folder. You can reference images like `![Alt text](./assets/my-image.png)`.
- Commit your changes, then refresh your GitHub Pages site to see updates.

# How to Publish Your Website
- Go to your repository → **Settings** (top navigation bar) → **Pages**(left panel).
- Select `main` branch and root(`/`). Click **Save**.
- Wait a few minutes; your site will be live at the URL shown in the Pages settings.

# Notes
- Your reflections are written in Markdown. A Markdown cheatsheet is posted on D2L to help with formatting.
- Your site may take a few minutes to update after each commit. *A commit means saving your changes to GitHub*
